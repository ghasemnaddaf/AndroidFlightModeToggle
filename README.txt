This code works with Android ver <=4.2 or "rooted" android to toggle the flight mode. 
One application is to schedule an automatic flight mode at night for a good sleep :-), and re-schedule to the normal mode for the morning.
This is a good example of scheduling broadcasts in Android with multiple customized broadcast receivers.
The same template can be used for scheduling other "Intents" periodically or as one-time events.

For any feedback please email me.
